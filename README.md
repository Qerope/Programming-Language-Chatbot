# Programming Language Chatbot

This is a simple chatbot that can answer common questions about programming languages. The chatbot uses the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate responses to user input.

## Requirements

To run this chatbot, you'll need to sign up for an OpenAI API key and install the OpenAI Python library. You can sign up for an API key [here](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) and install the Python library using the following command:

```
pip install openai
```

## Usage

To use this chatbot, simply run the `chatbot.py` script using the following command:

```
python chatbot.py
```


Once the chatbot is running, you can type in questions about programming languages and the chatbot will generate responses using the OpenAI GPT-3 API.
